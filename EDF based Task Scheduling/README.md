**FreeRTOS related**:

So can we do it in like Arduino IDE. just create functions that can schedule or do we have to use FreeRTOS cause am not able to fix dependencies errors

- Good overview on types of scheduling algorithms [pdf](resources/TypesOfSchedulingAlgorithms-umich.pdf)
    - Priority Inversion seems trivial especially for our EINSat use.. like sat might need some time to let's say take reading of battery, which will be handled by a subfunction. 
    - Unless we add manual delay there does not seem to be an efficient and continous way..
    - The task will have to be paused, run the other "task" (function) get output and then resume the current task.
- Interesting task scheduling method (round robin) - https://www.javatpoint.com/os-round-robin-scheduling-algorithm
    I believe most modern day kernels use this

- Efficient / Naive EDF [pdf page no 28](resources/Efficient%20Scheduling%20Library%20-%20Robin%20Kase.pdf)
    Did not quite understand the difference
    
- Scheduling tasks based on how much power it consumes. [pdf](resources/Making%20FreeRTOS%20-%20Energy%20Saving%20Technique.pdf)
    Might be useful for EINSat usecase of having limited power, but microcontrollers also don't take up a lot of power
    Also could use deep sleep, and only awake the main core on interrupts (while taking luminosity observation or something)

*Preemptive scheduling* seems super intersting
> "Preemptive scheduling is a popular and elegant scheduling mechanism. A simple view of how it works is to picture a timer interrupt that happens at a fixed rate. Each time the interrupt happens the interrupt service routine (ISR) switches the stack to a stack for another task, and when it returns from the ISR it returns to another task. From the taskâ€™s point of view it is periodically interrupted and it just takes a while before control is returned to it."
